# dots_and_setup

### DEH 08-09-18


My collection of dotfiles, lists of installed software, and setup scripts,
to make it easier for me to migrate and/or recreate my working environment
to/on new machines.


Run main_setup.sh to setup anything that be can done automatically. Then 
remaining software should be installed manually (see ./lists/manual_pkg).
[NOTE: The scripts may break part-way because of unforeseen dependencies, 
but should nonetheless serve as a good record of stuff I need to do.]
